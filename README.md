Under development

Just my works, there's nothing to see.

To compile it you need to get latest version of AMXX-Studio (1.4.3)

Or just use one I added in 'compile' folder. Run compile.exe with file inside this folder and it'll compile it. If you want to compile it manually use amxxpc.exe (launch with .bat file)
